=head1 METHODS 

=cut 

=head2 at_ec2

Determines if the code is running at EC2.

The answer is cached because typically the result does not change
unless you're able to move processes between an EC2 instance an a non
EC2 instance.

Returns a boolean value answering the question.

=cut

my $target_hostname = 'instance-data.ec2.internal';

my $known_answer;

sub at_ec2 {
    return $known_answer if defined($known_answer);

    my $res   = Net::DNS::Resolver->new;
    my $reply = $res->search($target_hostname);
    
    if ($reply) {
        return $known_answer = 1;
    }
    
    return $known_answer = 0;
